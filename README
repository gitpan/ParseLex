DESCRIPTION

The Parse::Lex.pm module for perl5 is an object-oriented generator of
lexical analyzers.

 *************************WARNING!************************************
 * The Parse::Lex class doesn't work with a perl version inferior to *
 * 5.004. Use the Parse::Clex instead.                               *
 *********************************************************************

Documentation is in French. It's not a linguistic provocation!  I am
very busy, and I've no time to translate the documentation in English
(and I know that the result will not be perfect ;-).

A collection of examples demonstrating various Parse::Lex features can
be found in the "examples" directory.
