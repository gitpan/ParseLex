                       Parse::Lex.pm/Parse::Token.pm - 1.15

___________
DESCRIPTION

The Parse::Lex.pm module for perl5 is an object-oriented generator of
lexical analysers.

Parse::Lex.pm is currently under development but perfectly usable
(IMHO). Documentation is in French. It's not a linguistic provocation!
I am very busy, and I've no time to translate the documentation in
English (and I know that the result will not be perfect ;-).

A collection of examples demonstrating various Parse::Lex features can
be found in the "examples" directory.
